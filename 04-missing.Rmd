# Missing values

```{r}
#load necessary packages
library(ggplot2)
library(visdat)
library(naniar)
```
Missing values can complicate data exploration, therefore our aim is to find and remove them.

```{r}

#working with both combined data sets
#read both data files

combh <- read_csv("data/combined/Batting.csv")
combp <- read_csv("data/combined/Pitching.csv")

```

```{r echo=TRUE}

#calculation of number of NA's in data

colSums(is.na(combh)) #hitting\batting data
colSums(is.na(combp)) #pitching data

```
We can see that there are no NA values in either of the data sets, hence there is no missing data.
Plotting the two data sets asserts this.

```{r}
vis_miss(combh)
vis_miss(combp)

gg_miss_var(combh)
gg_miss_var(combp)
```
